Solveig is a stressed sans that draws inspiration from calligraphy and classic
inscriptions. Its ascenders and descenders are long and expressive; in place of
finials, its terminals taper to points. It is well suited for display, but
remains very readable at smaller sizes in longer passages.

Solveig is named after Edvard Grieg’s “Solveig’s Song,” a quiet piece of
concentrated, chilled emotion that accompanied me through the entire design
process.

## Installing

Download the ZIP of all the files:

[SolveigComplete.zip](https://github.com/chuckmasterson/solveig/raw/master/SolveigComplete.zip)

Extract it, and you've got .otf files, which your computer should be able to make sense of. Install it in whatever way you normally install fonts.

## Developing

You can choose from .ufo files or .otf files; they're both here. Be aware that I haven't done any work on this font in many years, and the .ufo files were automatically generated by FontForge.

Don't let the scent of abandonware scare you off, though; I'm proud of this
font and it hasn't decayed since I finished it. There are no pictures as of
yet, but I expect to have a chance to put some up soon.
